# Disease Prediction (Classification) Model

## Introduction
This repository has a machine learning model which predicts [specific diseases such as] based on input data. The model uses promimnent python libraries such as numpy,pandas to analyze historical health data and make predictions.

## Project Structure
- 'DiseasePredictionModelFinal.ipynb' file which has the code for the implementation and execution of the model.
- 'Testing.csv' for the testing data of the model.
- 'Training.csv' for the training data of the model.
