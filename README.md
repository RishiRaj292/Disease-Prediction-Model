# Disease Prediction Model

## Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict [specific disease, e.g., diabetes, heart disease] based on input data. The model utilizes [mention technologies used, e.g., Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch] to analyze historical health data and make predictions.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory containing datasets used in this project.
- `src/`: Source code for the disease prediction model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model testing.
- `requirements.txt`: Required libraries to run the model.
